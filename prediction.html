    <h2><header>my prediction for 2022's sneaker trends</header></h2>
    <p>these are all my predictions of which i think will be big/and are already starting to become sneaker trends starting from a few specifics for this winter, then transitioning to spring, summer and fall. a lot (most) of my shoe predictions are pink because it's more in style now in my opinion too.</p>
    <li><b>mini bailey bow ii ugg boot</li></b>

    <br>
    <p>these ugg boots have taken a toll on teen girls and young adults seen in a certain aesthetic because of its look and colour, called 'coquette aesthetic'. they're cute, iconic and such a good basic for the winter and fall. they're already selling out in the pink since it's the most popular.</p>
    <li><b>moon boot</b></li>

    <p>to be honest, when i first saw these i had a feeling they would become popular because of the style. i wasn't into them at first until i saw a few celebrities such as dua lipa and hailey bieber in them and now i have a feeling they might catch on as a trend soon enough.</p>
    <li><b>platform soled sneakers</b></li>

    <p>it's not the most specific prediction but i feel like all sorts of sneakers, boots, etc in general are starting to make a comeback like platform combat boots, loafers, converse, nikes and especially since these nike dunk rebels that i am pretty sure has been dropped this year, they'll become trendy this 2022.</p>
    <li><b>designer sneakers</b></li>

    <p>there are so many designer brands that released sneakers last year collabing with nike, converse, etc and lots were quite the rage so maybe they'll be back again this year!</p>
